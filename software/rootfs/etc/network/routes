# This configuration file is read by the static-routes if-updown script
# and the /etc/init.d/networking-routes script to setup a list of 
# routes associated either with a given interface or global routes.
#
# DO NOT configure default gateway routes for interfaces here, they should be
# configured in the /etc/network/interfaces ('gateway' option) instead
#
# This file includes a list of routes for different networks following
# the format: # Network Netmask Gateway Interface
#
# Example:
# 172.1.1.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.0.1 eth0
#
# 
# If you want to add a route that will be added regardless of interfaces
# you will have to use the 'any' interface. This can be handy if you want
# to share the same configuration file between different machines in which
# the kernel names given to interfaces vary.
# 
# It is also useful to add a 'reject' route that is not assigned to any
# interface. 
#
# For example:
#
# 172.1.1.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.0.1 any
# 10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 reject any
#
#
# This file is read by:
#
#   - /etc/network/if-up.d/20static-routes when an interface is configured
#
#   - /etc/init.d/networking-routes to add the 'all' interfaces routes
