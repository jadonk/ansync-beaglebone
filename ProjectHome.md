The **Beaglebot** is project aimed at building open source robotics using the
[beaglebone single board computer](http://beagleboard.org/static/beaglebone/latest/README.htm).

Why beaglebone? It's a true opensource platform with enough power to run a "real" linux distribution.

**Rev 1** is a wireless 3 wheel robot powered by a Beaglebone and [Ansync AN2053](https://ansync.com/product/AN2053) motor controllers.

Here's our very first go at driving it around on it's own power.  Clearly there's a lot of work do to - but also lots of potential.

[Bom](http://ansync-beaglebone.googlecode.com/git/bom.pdf) for mechanical parts.  Unfortunetly, the Bison motors were purchased surplus and have limited availability.  Anyone have better ideas?

**Rev 2**

We're on the search for a better set of motors for Rev 2.  The current motors are unavailable, too big, too slow, and probably too expensive.

The working list so far:
